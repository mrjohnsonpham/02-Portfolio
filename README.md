# Unit 02 Responsive Portfolio

First, you will use notice that I used a Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio.

* Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, developed my portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio minimized the use of media queries 
by using grid systems with containers, rows and columns on my landing page.


  My portfolio has the following: 

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar that is consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page has contain links such as the Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links work.

* Used semantic html.

* Contains personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

Last, I made sure to check my code in an HTML validation service to ensure that each page had valid HTML.
